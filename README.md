# Fizz Buzz
Fizz Buzz is a common developer interview question; so common it’s almost cliché!\
Write a FizzBuzz.java program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100… with a catch:

- For multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number.
- For the multiples of 5, print Buzz.
- For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.
